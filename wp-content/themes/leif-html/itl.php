                  Insurance is a necessary part of our lives. So why is it that no one can read a medical claim denial bill or understand the language in a premium? Why can an insurance company drop you without explanation?
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are going to change this but we need your help. Below, read our Consumer Bill of Rights Legislation and then call me and tell me your insurance horror story. It is time to become empowered and take back control.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have been dealing with insurance companies across the USA for over 25 years. I have helped consumers recover hundreds of millions of dollars for claims owed by insurers. I have watched the insurance companies develop complex premium and claims programs that are designed to stump even the brightest among us.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They have call centers that are unaccountable to anyone and lawyers that fight even the smallest case, scaring off the consumer attorneys that you need to get a claim paid. I see people just give up as walls are thrown up by insurance adjusters. Even the simple act of getting someone on the phone is an ordeal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This needs to stop. In 2007 I helped pass a consumer protection law in Oregon. We are going to do it again. The Consumer Bill of Rights you see here is a fair, consumer-friendly bill that will bring fairness and equality to the relationship we all must enter into to function responsibly in today’s society.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We need your stories for legislators. Give us a call and tell us your medical, auto or any other insurance horror story. We will keep all names confidential if you desire. Help us equalize and bring fairness back to the playing field
